Thank you for using Morse Code 4 Fun ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected and used when you use our application.

### Information We Collect

The App itself does not directly collect any personally identifiable information from you. Your progress in the learning modules and games is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to us.

### Third-Party Services: Advertising

To support the free version of the App, we use Google AdMob, a third-party advertising service. When you use the free version of the App, AdMob may collect and use information about you to provide personalized ads.

The types of information AdMob may collect include:
* **Device Information:** Such as your device's unique identifiers, model, operating system, and IP address.
* **Ad-Related Information:** Information about the ads served to you, such as which ads were shown, if you clicked on them, and your interactions with them.
* **Location Information:** Non-precise location information may be inferred from your IP address.

### User Consent (GDPR & Other Regulations)

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and other regions with data privacy laws, we are required to obtain your consent before AdMob can show personalized ads.

Upon first launching the App, you will be presented with a consent form. This form will allow you to choose whether to consent to the collection of your data for personalized advertising. You can change your consent choices at any time within the App's settings.

### Your Rights (CCPA/CPRA)

For users who are residents of California, you have the right to opt-out of the "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. You can exercise this right through the options provided in the consent form presented at launch or within the App's settings.

### In-App Purchases (Pro Version)

If you choose to upgrade to the "Pro" version of the App, all advertising and related data collection from Google AdMob will be disabled. We do not collect any personal information during the in-app purchase process.

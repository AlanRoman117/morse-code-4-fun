# Enemy Transmission 001

## The Whispers of the Atlantic

The year is 1943. The North Atlantic, a vast, unforgiving expanse, churns under a perpetually grey sky. Below the surface, German U-boats, silent hunters, stalk Allied convoys. Above, Allied destroyers, vigilant shepherds, crisscross the waves, their sonar pinging into the depths.

On board the HMS *Vigilant*, a British destroyer, the radio room is a hive of quiet intensity. Petty Officer Thomas "Tommy" Miller, a young man with sharp ears and an even sharper mind, hunches over his receiver, the static a constant companion. His mission: intercept enemy communications. Every crackle, every faint buzz, could be a clue, a piece of the puzzle that might save hundreds of lives.

Today, the air feels different. A storm is brewing, both in the sky and, Tommy suspects, in the unseen war beneath the waves. He adjusts his headphones, fine-tuning the dial. Hours pass, marked only by the rhythmic creak of the ship and the occasional, terse report from the bridge. Then, a faint, almost imperceptible series of clicks breaks through the static.

Tommy's heart quickens. Morse code. German. He leans closer, his pencil poised over his notepad. The signal is weak, fading in and out, but he strains to catch every dot and dash. It's a burst transmission, designed to be quick and hard to pinpoint. He scribbles furiously, his mind racing to translate the jumbled letters.

"K-O-N-V-O-I... S-I-E-B-E-N... N-O-R-D-W-E-S-T..."

He pieces it together. "Convoy Seven... Northwest..." A chill runs down his spine. This isn't just a routine message. This is a targeting report. A U-boat has spotted Convoy ONS-7, a vital lifeline of supplies heading for Britain.

He bursts out of the radio room, the decoded message clutched in his hand. "Captain! I've got something! U-boat contact, Convoy ONS-7, bearing northwest!"

Captain Davies, a grizzled veteran of the Atlantic, snatches the note. His eyes, usually weary, now gleam with a fierce determination. "Sound the alarm! All hands to battle stations!"

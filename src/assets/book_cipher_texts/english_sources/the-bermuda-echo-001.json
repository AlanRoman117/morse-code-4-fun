Mayday… Mayday… Flight 19… lost contact…  Years later, a retired Navy cryptographer, Elias Thorne, obsessively analyzes the recovered transmissions. He believes there's a hidden message within the garbled signals, a clue to what truly happened over the Bermuda Triangle.  It's not just about navigation errors, he whispers, it's something… else."

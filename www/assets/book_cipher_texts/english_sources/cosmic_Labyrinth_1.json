The deep space exploration vessel, 'Stardust Drifter', on a routine survey mission near the Kepler-186 system, registered an energy signature unlike anything previously cataloged. Commander Eva Rostova, a veteran of countless light-years, felt a familiar thrill mixed with apprehension.\n\n\"Magnify sector Gamma-7, Lieutenant Jian Li,\" Eva commanded, her voice calm despite the tremor in her hand. On the main viewscreen, a swirling vortex of impossible colors and distorted spacetime resolved. It wasn't just an energy signature; it was a tear, a wound in the fabric of the universe.\n\n\"Commander,\" Jian's voice was hushed, \"the readings are... paradoxical. It seems to be both infinitely dense and emitting zero-point energy. It's pulling us in, slowly, but the gravitational forces don't match any known model.\"\n\nEva nodded. \"Prepare a probe. And someone get Dr. Aris Thorne to the bridge. He always wanted to see something new. I suspect he's about to get his wish, and then some.\"\n\n---\n\n*This is a sample Pro book.
